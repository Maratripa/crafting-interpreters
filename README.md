# This is my implementation of the interpreter/compiler for Lox

The book can be found on [https://craftinginterpreters.com/](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)

Some challenges are implemented, the opcode CONSTANT_LONG is implemented but not widely used.

The implementation of jlox is something i'm not entirely proud of... It works, but the error system I implemented is sh*t.
